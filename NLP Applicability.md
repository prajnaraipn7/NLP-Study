NLP Applicability:

Text summarization:

- We can summarize big text and we can use the parameters like
  1. % of text we want in the final summary
  2. Choosing the +ve and -ve words for summarization
- Eg: Online news feed

Voice Base tools:

- They have a large set of trained data, which consists of dataset of words, sent aces and grammar
- While the question/command is posed on this tool, based on the training it preprocesses and tries to predict
- Though its speech/voice..here it is converted to text..resulting text passed to NLP system yo perform the prediction and gets returned as voice
- Eg: Siri, Alexa

Information Extraction:

- It involves text processing from python
- Eg: Web Scraping

Spam Filtering:

- Filtering of the emails to spam is by analyzing the subject line with content of the message(body)
- It uses NLTK libraries

Language translation:

- It relies heavily on NLP
- Helps in translating one language to another
- Here model is trained with vocabulary/grammar/context tagging of languages

Sentiment Analysis:

* To understand the sentiment involved with the comments in social media/ reaction on a movie.
